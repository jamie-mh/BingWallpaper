Tested on Windows 10 version 1709 with .NET 4.6.1

### Limitations

- Can only download wallpapers in 1080p (this is due to Bing not providing any higher res).

### Usage

Open the project in Visual Studio and run it, that's all you need to do. It will automatically set the wallpaper for you provided you are connected to the Internet.
